It’s also home to people who care for one another, who work hard, who love this country, and are truly grateful for the freedoms it provides. As I like to say, Iowa is one big small town, neighbor helping neighbor is in our DNA. From the sick farmer who can’t harvest his crops to the single mom who loses her job and is struggling to get back on her feet, the town, the community helps them get through it. But what happens when a storm rips through almost the entire state? When it’s not one farmer who lost his crop, but hundreds? When it’s not one neighbor who is without food, but thousands? That happened just two weeks ago. A storm called a derecho with hurricane force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops, left thousands without power. It destroyed homes, wrecked lives, and left devastation in its wake. It was the worst storm in our state’s history and Iowans did what you expect Iowans to do.

Yes, we’ve talked a lot about our next President and Vice President, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We’ve talked about how they’ll tackle the challenges we face and lead our country to a brighter future. And we’ve seen that our party is ready to lead, not just now, but into the next generation.

In May, 2017, I was invited to join a small meeting in D.C. with a handful of other organization leaders to give updates to the VP on our work. The VP came over, and I tried to play a cool, “Well, my Grammy would be furious if she knew I was at a meeting with you and didn’t get a photo.” “Grammy?” The VP said, perking up as we pose for the photo, you can see here. “Let’s call her.” I called her. “Someone wants to talk to you.” “Hi Grammy, this is Joe Biden.” She was overwhelmed. Grammy went on to tell him her second eldest, my aunt Michelle was in the hospital, colon cancer, advanced, that she was really sick. The VP’s posture changed immediately. “I’m so sorry, Grammy. I’m so, so sorry. You know, my son Beau died of cancer. As a parent, you should never have to even think of one day burying a child. It’s a nightmare.” Amanda Litman: ( 09:45 )  He stepped away speaking personally with her about sitting in a hospital room with a sick child, about pain. I could hear her choking up on the phone. “I’m giving Amanda my personal home phone number. You need anything, you call me. I’ll come to the hospital and sit with you. Anything.” Grammy still talks about that call. “He’s a genuinely nice man,” she says. “He just gets it.” Her grief, and my family’s grief mattered to him. Our entire country is grieving. We are all going through trauma. Our next president needs to be the one helping us heal. That’s why I’m glad and excited to vote this fall, not just against Trump, but genuinely for Joe Biden.',\n",

Next week, it will be the Republican Party’s turn to hold their convention. On behalf of their speakers and staff, I hope their organizers will take safety as seriously as we have. And then it will be up to you, America, you’ll have heard from two very different candidates for President. You’ll be able to dig into the details of their respective plans for solving the challenges we face, and decide which plan you think will work for you and your family.',\n",

       " ['But the choice this year is deeper than that. No matter what you think about Donald Trump or Joe Biden, no matter which party you belong to, or whether you belong to any party at all, your job in this election is to decide what kind of movement is capable of being the vehicle for the change we need. Can a movement that demands absolute loyalty to one man and his personal agenda really ever make this country greater? Or do we do better when we join together in a movement of shared values, one that amplifies our diverse voices. We’ve got one more night to show America what our path forward looks like. Not one man, boasting that he alone can fix it, but every day people coming together to face our challenges with unity and determination.

We are just coming off a record week, a heat wave that led to 130 degree temperatures, the highest temperature ever recorded in California, arguably the world’s history here in our State. The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier. Climate change is real. If you are in denial about climate change, come to California. 11,000 dry lightening strikes, we had over a 72 hour period, leading to this unprecedented challenge with these wildfires.',\n",

Just today, the President of United States threatened the State of California, 40 million Americans, that happen to live here in the State of California to defund our efforts on wildfire suppression, because he said we hadn’t raked enough leaves. He can’t make that up, nor can he make up the fact we’re involved in over 90 lawsuits with the Trump administration on clean air, on clean water, on endangered species, on pesticides. There is so much at stake in this election, none more important than the work Joe Biden did with Barack Obama on the vehicle emissions standards, the fuel efficiency standards. It will save billions and billions of dollars taxpayers, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. There is so much at stake in this election.',\n",

There is so much at stake in this election. And I just want to close by reminding each and every one of you. The future is not just something to experience, it’s something to manifest. It’s inside of us, not just in front of us. It’s our decision, not our conditions that will determine our fate and future. So let us resolve that after this historic night, this incredible, incredible week, this remarkable convention, that we do everything in our power to get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in to the White House in January, 2021.',\n",

Let us begin you and I together. One nation under God, united in our love for American, united in our love for each other, for love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear, and right is more powerful and dark. This is our moment. This is our mission.

We chose a different path, a man who is not a politician, a man who cares, a man who loves America and all Americans. A man who works tirelessly for you, even tonight during this nomination.

       " ['Good evening. It is an honor to be with you tonight. My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our republic. Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. I am here tonight to tell you, to warn you, that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love. For decades, ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists. They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life. All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country. We may not have realized it at the time, but Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization. Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob – Charlie Kirk: ( 35:03 )  … was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life. Our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values. President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life. The American way of life means you follow the law. You work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values and you work to create a civil society. The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion and that church is more essential than a casino. And it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics. The American way of life is being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful, activists who have never built anything in their lives. They have us locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['We are kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state funded propaganda on major tech platforms. This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the Union from disintegration. This election is not just the most important of our lifetime. It is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865. By re-electing Trump, we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them. We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities. We’ll be a country that rises to higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible. A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful not angry that we live in the United States.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way. We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead. We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for the defender of Western civilization, our champion, my friend, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.',\n",

       " ['I’m Rebecca Friedrichs, a veteran California public school educator. I’m here to give voice to America’s great teachers because our voices have been silenced for decades by unions who claim to represent us. They do not. When other dedicated teachers and I served within the unions, we spoke up in defense of children, parents, scientific fact and American values. For our trouble, we were brutalized, booed off the platform, barred from committees, shouted down and even spit upon by union leaders. This is how unions treat devoted teachers, but what’s even worse is how their agenda of control deceives Americans and our children. They’ve intentionally rewritten American history to perpetuate division, pervert the memories of our American founders and disparage our Judeo-Christian virtues. They’re lenient discipline policies morphed our schools into war zones and they back defunding police and abolishing ICE. Unions collect billions annually from unsuspecting teachers and push this radical agenda into our classrooms against our will. Why.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['The only way to keep a free republic is with a well-educated moral citizenry that can self- govern. Unions are subverting our republic, so they undermine educational excellence, morality, law and order. That’s why they spend hundreds of millions annually to defeat charter schools and school choice. Trapping so many precious, low-income children in dangerous, corrupt, and low-performing schools. To fight back on behalf of children and America, brave teachers brought a lawsuit against unions. And do you know who intervened against us? The Obama, Biden administration and California Attorney General Kamala Harris. They argued against us at the U.S. Supreme Court. Their comrades labeled us spawns of Satan and slandered us in mainstream media. No matter their abuse, we’ll keep fighting for the country and children we love just like President Trump. He’s breaking the union’s grip on our schools. That’s why unions have tried to destroy him since the day he was elected. But President Trump isn’t afraid to fight for what’s right. He won’t back down. His courage gives great teachers renewed hope?',\n",

       " ['He’s even proposed education freedom scholarships to return control to parents, protect religious liberties and empower kids to escape dangerous, low-performing schools. The Republican platform supports educational freedom. The Democrat Party does not. Democrats stand with deceptive teachers unions who pick on loving teachers and little kids. President Trump stands with America’s families, great teachers, and most importantly, our children. So America’s great teachers, let’s stand with President Trump in protection of the kids and country we love.',\n",

My husband and I own Mountain Mudd Espresso. We are not some multinational corporation. Our success is not measured by stockholders but by our neighbors, the people we see at church and at jujitsu school with our son. Mountain Mudd Espresso is the American story. A story not just for entrepreneurs but for millions of hardworking men and women who are building their American dream every day. A few months ago like so many businesses, we got the crushing news, a large event we were serving was canceled because of the virus. Our business was on the brink, threatened to be shut down from losses that were not our fault. I was scared. I thought of our 50 employees, the Mountain Mudd family.',\n",

I’m not too proud to admit that I fell on my knees and prayed, Lord, what do I do? His words rang clear, keep on working, it will be okay. I had faith. And let me tell you, you have to have faith when your husband is a Marine and a police officer who was shot at on the job. And when you run a business, a little faith goes a long way. Faith in Jesus and faith in America. But I’m worried we have a generation of Americans who have been told that the American dream doesn’t exist. That’s a lie. I know because I live that dream. That’s why I feel so strongly that we need a president who believes in the American dream like President Donald Trump, now more than ever.',\n",

Not only were we able to keep every single employee but we’ve been hiring weekly ever since. I feel for local businesses across America who are under assault from shutdowns, from riots, and now facing the terrifying prospect of Joe Biden coming after everything we’ve built. I am so grateful we have leaders like President Trump, standing up for local businesses like mine. Thank you, President Trump, it is exciting to be part of the great American comeback story.',\n",

We see the choice clearly, strength or weakness, energy or confusion, success or failure. President Trump is the first president since Reagan not to start a new war. Biden has foolishly cheerled decades of war without winning, without end. President Trump knows we are strongest when we fight hardest, not in distant deserts, but for our fellow Americans. We must fight to save America now or we may lose her forever. Joe Biden might not even notice. Settle for Biden, that’s the hashtag promoted by AOC and the socialists. The woketopians will settle for Biden because they will make him an extra in a movie written, produced, and directed by others. It’s a horror film really. They’ll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['And the police aren’t coming when you call in Democrat run cities, they’re already being defunded, disbanded. Blaming our best and allowing society’s worst, that’s the story they write in Hollywood. That’s if the lights even stay on in California anymore, a state that cannot keep power running for its own people should not send its junior Senator to be vice president. They used to write only in fiction, but nightmares are becoming real. Cops killed, children shot. At the Democrat convention they say, if you vote against Trump, it will all stop. Appeasement is never a winning strategy. No, we won’t settle for violence in our neighborhoods or at our border. We won’t settle for decades of bad decisions by basement dwelling Joe Biden. We settle a continent. We know that the frontier, the horizon, even the stars belonged to us. Donald Trump like all builders is a visionary. That which is built in the mind is even more powerful than the brick and mortar that holds it together.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['First comes the mind, then the making. First comes the vision, then the work. Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson are immortal precisely because of the pull they have on our imagination. You cannot cancel a culture that loves its heroes. The dangerous left need America to be weaker to accomplish their goal of replacing her. We know that to make America great again, we must first make something of ourselves. That is the meaning of true strength. My great-grandfather was a railroad man. As a Florida man, I watch our rockets routinely send the brightest beyond the heavens with our flag and our hope. America is the greatest country that has ever existed. Don’t let any celebrity athlete or politician tell you otherwise.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['President Trump sometimes raises his voice and a ruckus. He knows that’s what it takes to raise an army of patriots who love America and will protect her. We must win this election if we cherish our country as much as we should, for there is no place to run, no refuge for freedom should we fail. America is not just an idea or a constitution, it is our home. We must protect our home with unbreakable made in America strength. Strength I see every day in President Donald Trump. Thank you.',\n",

Let me remind you, the Democrats have controlled this part of Baltimore City for over 50 years and they run this beautiful place right into the ground. Abandoned buildings, liquor stores on every corner, drug addicts, guns on the street, that’s now the norm in many neighborhoods. You think Maryland taxpayers would be getting a whole lot since our taxes are out of control, instead we’re paying for decades of incompetence and corruption. Sadly, the same cycle of decay exists in many of America’s Democrat run cities. And yet the Democrats still assume that black people will vote for them. No matter how much they let us down and take us for granted. We’re sick of it. We’re not going to take it anymore. The days of blindly supporting the Democrats are coming to an end.',\n",

Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves, that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views. We’re not buying the lies anymore. You and your party have neglected us for far too long. We want safety in our neighborhoods. We want to make the most of the federal opportunity zone I’m standing in right now in West Baltimore. We want higher paying jobs and more business opportunities. We want lower taxes. We want school choice. We want a chance to get ahead, not just get by. That’s what President Trump promised and that’s what President Trump delivered. I want Baltimore to be an example to republicans around the country that we can compete in our inner cities if we reach out to the citizens and deliver real results.',\n",

I’m Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and on behalf of everyone in our party and President Trump, thank you for tuning in as we kick off this historic convention. As we speak to you tonight, we send our thoughts and prayers to those facing terrible fires in California, recovering from storms in Iowa, and preparing for hurricanes in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. Democrats started their convention last week with Eva Longoria, a famous Hollywood actress who played a housewife on T.V. Well, I’m actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school, who happens to be only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican party.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['And unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn’t choose me because I’m a woman, he chose me because I was the best person for the job. Four years ago, President Trump started a movement unlike any other. And over the next four days, we will hear from a few of the millions of hardworking everyday Americans who have benefited from his leadership. If you watched the DNC last week, you probably noticed that Democrats spent a lot of time talking about how much they despise our president. But we heard very little about their actual policies. Policies that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Policies like banning fossil fuels, eliminating private health insurance, taxpayer funded healthcare for people who come here illegally and defunding the police.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['Their argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact that they think he’s a nice guy. Well, let me tell you, raising taxes on 82% of Americans is not nice. Eliminating 10 million good paying oil and gas jobs is not nice. Policies that force jobs to flee our country or allow abortion up until the point of birth are not nice. The truth is, there’s only one person who has empathized with everyday Americans and actually been fighting for them over the past four years and that is President Donald Trump. In the nearly four years I’ve worked on behalf of President Trump, I’ve seen up close a man who has a deep love for family. A man who has reverence for the office of the presidency. A man with an incredible respect for law enforcement and our military. I’ve seen private moments where he comforts Americans in times of pain and sadness.',\n",
       "  'Republican'],\n",
       " ['Now everyone knows he can be tough. He’s tough when he takes on China. Tough when he works to fix our unfair trade deals. Tough when he fights to secure our borders. President Trump is always going to be tough when he is fighting for the American people because nice guys like Joe cared more about countries like China and Iran than the United States of America. Tonight begins a new chapter in the great American story, a story that has inspired the world for generations. And when we re-elect President Trump this November, the best is yet to come. This election is the most important in our lifetime. Your vote counts more than ever. If you want to check your voting status, secure your ballot, or register to vote, text vote to 8-8-0-2-2.

It’s about an American ambassador to the United Nations and it’s a speech she gave to this convention. She called for the reelection of the Republican president she served and she called out his democratic opponent, a former vice president from a failed administration. That ambassador said, and I quote, ” Democrats always blame America first.” The year was 1984. The president was Ronald Reagan and ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick’s words are just as true today. Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first and he has earned four more years as president. It was an honor of a lifetime to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now the UN is not for the faint of heart. It’s a place where dictators, murderers and thieves denounce America, and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills. Well, President Trump put an end to all of that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America and we stood against our enemies. Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history. Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash.

Thank you, goodnight and may God always bless America. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:24:04 )  Good evening America. I’m Donald Trump Jr. We’re here tonight to talk about the great American story, to talk about this country we all love, this land of promise and opportunity, of heroes and greatness. Just a few short months ago, we were seeing the American dream become a reality for more of our citizens than ever before. The greatest prolonged economic expansion in American history, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, the lowest unemployment rates ever for black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and pretty much every other demographic group. And then, courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party, the virus struck. The president quickly took action and shut down travel from China. Joe Biden and his Democrat allies, called my father a racist and a xenophobe for doing it. They put political correctness ahead of the safety and security of the American people. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:25:03 )  Fortunately, as the virus began to spread, the president acted quickly and insured ventilators got the hospitals that needed them most. He delivered PP and E to our brave frontline workers and he rallied the mighty American private sector to tackle this new challenge. There’s more work to do, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Job gains are outpacing what the so called experts expected, but Biden’s radical left wing policies would stop our economic recovery cold. He’s already talking about shutting the country down again. It’s madness. Democrats claim to be for workers, but they’ve spent the entire pandemic trying to sneak a tax break for millionaires and Democrat States, into the COVID relief bill. Then they attacked my father for suspending the payroll tax for middle class workers. In fact, if you think about it, Joe Biden’s entire economic platform seems designed to crush the working men and women. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:26:03 )  He supported the worst trade deals in the history of the planet. He voted for the NAFTA nightmare. Down the tubes went our auto industry. He pushed for TPP. Goodbye manufacturing jobs. Beijing Biden is so weak on China, that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden. They know he’ll weaken us both economically and on a world stage. Biden also wants to bring in more illegal immigrants to take jobs from American citizens. His open border policies would drive wages down for Americans at a time when low income workers were getting real wage increases for the first time in modern history. He’s pledged to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which were the biggest in our country. After eight years of Obama and Biden’s slow growth, Trump’s policies have been like rocket fuel to the economy and especially to the middle class. Biden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it in the swamp. That makes sense though, considering Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:27:14 )  For the past half century, he’s been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn’t do much in between. So if you’re looking for hope, look to the man who did what the failed Obama Biden administration never could do and built the greatest economy our country has ever seen. And President Trump will do it again. We will be stronger than ever because when we put our mind to it, there is no obstacle that America can’t surmount, except there’s a difference this time. In the past, both parties believed in the goodness of America. We agreed on where we wanted to go, we just disagreed on how to get there. This time, the other party is attacking the very principles on which our nation was founded. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the rule of the law. Thomas Jefferson famously said, “I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.” Our founders believed there was nothing more important than protecting our God given right to think for ourselves. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:28:29 )  Now the left, they’re trying to cancel all of those founders. They don’t seem to understand this important principle, in order to improve in the future, we must learn from our past, not erase it. So we’re not going to tear down monuments and forget the people who built our great nation. Instead, we will learn from our past so we don’t repeat any mistakes and we will work tirelessly to improve lives of all Americans. Joe Biden, and the radical left are now coming for our freedom of speech. They want to bully us into submission. If they get their way, it will no longer be the silent majority, it will be the silenced majority. This has to stop. Freedom of expression used to be a liberal value, at least before the radical left took over. Now the Republican party is the home of free speech. The place where anyone from any background can speak their mind and may the best ideas win. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:29:31 )  People of faith are under attack. You’re not allowed to go to church, but mass chaos in the streets gets a pass. It’s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school versus rioting, looting, and vandalism, or in the words of Biden and the Democrats, peaceful protesting. Anarchists have been flooding our streets and Democrat mayors are ordering the police to stand down. Small businesses across America, many of them minority owned, are being torched by mobs. The Democrat mayors pretend it’s not happening. They actually called it a summer of love. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:30:13 )  And that brings me to another important principle. Every American must be free to live without fear of violence in your country, in your communities and in your homes. All men and women are created equal and must be treated equally under the law. That’s why we must put an end to racism and we must ensure that any police officer who abuses their powers, is held accountable. What happened to George Floyd is a disgrace and if you know a police officer, you know they agree with that too, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that our police are American heroes. They deserve our deepest appreciation because no matter what the Democrats say, you and I both know when we dial 911, we don’t want it going to voicemail. So defunding the police is not an option. Everything starts with safety and security. You can’t have anything else without it. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:31:11 ) You can’t focus on building a better future for your children, without the peace of mind that they can study safely in their classrooms, play safely in their neighborhoods and sleep safely in their beds. But safety is only the beginning. Trump’s America is a land of opportunity, a place of promise. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that could afford the best schools and the finest universities, but a great education can not be the exclusive right of the rich and powerful. It must be accessible to all. And that’s why my dad is pro school choice. That’s why he’s called education access the civil rights issue, not just of our time, but of all time. It is unacceptable that too many African American and Hispanic American children are stuck in bad schools, just because of their zip code. Donald Trump will not stand for it. If Democrats really wanted to help minorities in underserved communities, instead of bowing to big money union bosses, they’d let parents choose what school is best for their kids. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:32:17 )  They’d limit immigration to protect American workers. They’d support the police who protect our neighborhoods. They’d learn how to negotiate trade deals that prioritize America’s interest for a change. They’d end the endless wars and quit sending our young people to solve problems in foreign lands. They’d cut taxes for families and workers. They’d create opportunity zones that drive investment into inner cities. In other words, if Democrats cared for the forgotten men and women of our country, they’d do exactly what President Trump is doing. America is the greatest country on earth, but my father’s entire worldview revolves around the idea that we can always do even better. Imagine the life you want to have, one with a great job, a beautiful home, a perfect family, you can have it. Imagine the country you want to live in, one with true equal opportunity, where hard work pays off and justice is serve with compassion and without partiality, you can have it. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:33:26 )  Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread, where heroes are celebrated and the good guys win, you can have it. That is the life, that is the country, that is the world that Donald Trump and the Republican party are after. And yes, you can have it because unlike Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats, our party is open to everyone. It starts by rejecting radicals who want to drag us into the dark and embracing the man who represents a bright and beautiful future for all. It starts by reelecting Donald J. Trump, president of the United States. Thank you and God bless America.',\n",

He actually understands the need for small businesses like my sisters, to survive. We aren’t the stereotypical conservative, I mean, we come from Hispanic descent and we’re millennial women, and that’s not what the media wants. And so somebody like AOC, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, this far left, these women come out with these very, very destructive political ideologies that are trying to infiltrate millennials and the next generation. I’ve decided to step up and say, “Well, we need a counter voice to these women.” Madeline Lauf: ( 02:37:47 )  There has been an assault on capitalism just generally and I think it’s very scary to imagine a Biden world where the progressive wing ideas are starting to take front and center stage. That will really choke the American economy. There will be over-regulation, over taxation, it’s very hard to innovate through those two things.

But regardless of the challenges presented to us, every four years, Americans come together to vote, to share stories of what makes our nation strong and the lessons we have learned that can strengthen it for further generations. Because while this election is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it is not solely about Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

My parents divorced when I was seven years old and we moved in with my grandparents into a two bedroom home, with me, my mom and my brother sharing a room and one bed. My mom worked 16 hours a day to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. She knew that if we could find the opportunity, bigger things would come.

In an overwhelmingly white district, the voters judged me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character.

This election is about your future and it is critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden said if a black man didn’t vote for him, he wasn’t truly black. Joe Biden said black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids. And while his words are one thing, his actions take it to a whole new level. In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of black Americans behind bars, President Trump’s criminal justice reform law, fixed many of the disparities Biden created and made our system more fair and just for all Americans.

And now in Joe Biden wants to come for your pocket books, unless of course, you’re a blue state millionaire. I’m serious, that’s one of their solutions for the pandemic. They want to take more money from your pocket and give it to Manhattan elites and Hollywood moguls, so they get a tax break. Republicans however, passed President Trump’s once in a generation tax reform bill, that lowered taxes for single moms, working families and those in need.

Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution, a fundamentally different America. If we let them, they will turn our country into a socialist utopia.

Without life, there can be no liberty. Without liberty, there is no happiness. Without equality, there is no opportunity. America has strived, since its founding to promote equality under the law, to correct injustices and to ensure opportunity for all. It is a work in progress, not always perfect. Some look at American opportunity and see only problems. They want equal outcome, not equal opportunities. They criticize without solutions, demand wealth without work. Their ways are historical failures, evidenced by tyranny and poverty, a prevailing darkness in every country that has been tried.

I was arrested for a string of bank robberies and based off of my criminal history, there is a potential that a federal judge can sentence me up to 23 years in a maximum security United States, federal penitentiary.

As I laid on that stainless steel cell, shackled by my hands and my feet, I heard God utter into my spirit. “My son, I honored which you asked me to do.” He said, “Never forget the promise that you made to me.” Ever since that day I got up off that floor and my life went in 180 degree turn in the other direction.',\n",

But today, praise God, I am filled with hope, a proud American citizen who has been given a second chance. My transformation began in a prison cell where I’ve found myself a three-time convicted felon, facing yet another sentence. I gave my life to Jesus and made him a promise that I would spend the rest of my days helping the others like me.

I was planning a medical mission trip to Guatemala to perform charity eye surgeries, and we needed money to fund the trip. Donald Trump offered to help and immediately came through for us. Not only did he support my medical mission to Guatemala, but he also contributed to another mission trip to Haiti, a year later. We performed hundreds of cataract surgeries in both countries.

But more important than simple agreement is accomplishment. President Trump gets things done. When some in Congress wanted a so-called revenue-neutral tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure that it was a true tax cut. I brought President Trump an idea for better, less expensive health insurance called Association Health Plans. Donald Trump overturned years of red tape and bureaucrats, and he made it happen.

The first real reform in a generation and one that sought to undo the harm that others, like Joe Biden.

Because the truth was not important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti- conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered.

Tonight, I’m honored to share my story of faith, family, and American freedom. As the daughter of Cuban immigrants, my story began in 1959 before I was born when my parents’ dreams of a prosperous life became a nightmare. Chaos spread quickly when Fidel Castro took control of Cuba. The government confiscated private property, stealing people’s homes, farms, and businesses. For my parents, the difficult decision to flee communist Cuba came when the Castro regime abolished religious freedom.',\n",

They peddle dangerous ideologies, cower to global progressives, and normalize socialism to dismantle our constitution. Let me assure you, socialism doesn’t offer opportunity. Socialism deprives. It is a falsehood that feigns promises for its masses and consistently yields only misery. President Ronald Reagan warned, “If we lose freedom here, there’s no place to escape to.”Truer words had never been spoken.',\n",

I have faith that Americans will choose the right path. In 2016, our country yearned for a leader who would work tirelessly to jumpstart our economy and fight for hardworking Americans. Since day one, President Donald Trump has put America first. His pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda has ushered in historically low unemployment, record job creation, higher wages, and rising home ownership. The president is fighting to rescue American jobs and industries for places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico. Jobs that were needlessly shipped overseas. He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China, and Nicaragua.
